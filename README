DateTimeX-Fiscal-Fiscal5253 version 0.01
===================================

Compute dates used to create a 52/53 week calendar from a DateTime object.

The 52/53 week calendar is a fiscal calendar standard widely used by
companies that need easy comparison between sales periods from year
to year. It is recognized as a Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and
by the IRS as an alternative to a traditional calendar year or a fiscal
year based on twelve calendar months.

Its primary distinguishing characteristic is that it always begins and ends
on the same weekday. In addition, a 52/53 week year will always have exactly
52 or 53 perfect seven day weeks, yielding calendars that always have
either 464 or 371 days. This is what makes it useful for year-over-year
comparisons where seasonal factors such as holidays are important.
